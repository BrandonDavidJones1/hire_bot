Log in to your Adobe Acrobat Sign account.

Look for "Account Settings," then a section like "API" or "API Applications."

Create a New API Application:
Click to "Create" a new application

Name: Enter something like LTS Discord Onboarding Bot.

Choose "Client Credentials".

You'll see a list of permissions. 
Please check the boxes for these exact scopes:

Save the application.

Copy & Securely Share Credentials:
After saving, the system will show a Client ID. Please copy this.

It will also provide a Client Secret. This is like a password and often shown only once. Please copy this immediately.

Send me both the Client ID and Client Secret

Identify Your Account's server region:

While logged into Adobe Sign, look at the URL in your browser's address bar.
It will look something like https://secure.na1.adobesign.com/... or https://secure.na4.adobesign.com/... or https://secure.eu1.adobesign.com/... etc.

Please tell me the part like na1, na4, or eu1. 
This helps me set the correct server addresses.

What I'll need from you:
Client ID
Client Secret
The identifier (e.g., na1, na4, eu1)



ADOBE_SIGN_API_HOST = api.na1.adobesign.com
ADOBE_SIGN_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL = https://secure.na1.adobesign.com/oauth/v2/token
